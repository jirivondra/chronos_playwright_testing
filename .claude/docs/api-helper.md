# ApiHelper

`ApiHelper` is the root class of the page object inheritance chain. It holds HTTP client logic with no Playwright dependency, so it can be used independently of the browser.

## Purpose

- Provides a single place for API credentials and base URL configuration.
- Exposes typed HTTP methods (`get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`) that every page object inherits.
- Allows tests to set up or tear down server state via API without going through the UI.

## Available methods

| Method       | Signature                                         | Description                                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `get`        | `get(endpoint: string)`                           | Sends a GET request                                               |
| `post`       | `post(endpoint: string, body?: object)`           | Sends a POST request with an optional JSON body                   |
| `put`        | `put(endpoint: string, body?: object)`            | Sends a PUT request with an optional JSON body                    |
| `delete`     | `delete(endpoint: string)`                        | Sends a DELETE request                                            |
| `apiRequest` | `apiRequest(method: HttpMethod, endpoint, body?)` | Generic dispatcher — use when the method is determined at runtime |

All methods return `Promise<Response>` (native `fetch` response). `get`, `post`, `put`, and `delete` are `protected` — accessible only within page objects. `apiRequest` is `public`.

`HttpMethod` is an exported enum (`HttpMethod.Get`, `HttpMethod.Post`, `HttpMethod.Put`, `HttpMethod.Delete`) from `support/constants/http_method.ts` — import it instead of passing raw method strings, the same rule as any other magic string.

Authentication and `Content-Type: application/json` are added automatically from environment variables (`API_BASE_URL`, `API_USERNAME`, `API_PASSWORD`).

## How to use inside a page object

Define endpoints as named class properties, then call the inherited methods — the same rule as for selectors: no inline strings scattered across methods.

```ts
export class UserPage extends ToTopButton {
  private readonly usersEndpoint = '/api/users'

  async createUser(payload: { name: string; email: string }) {
    const response = await this.post(this.usersEndpoint, payload)
    return response.json()
  }

  async deleteUser(id: number) {
    await this.delete(`${this.usersEndpoint}/${id}`)
  }

  async getUser(id: number) {
    const response = await this.get(`${this.usersEndpoint}/${id}`)
    return response.json()
  }
}
```

The `endpoint` parameter is appended to `API_BASE_URL`, so the property holds only the path:

```ts
// correct — named property, path only
private readonly usersEndpoint = '/api/users'

// incorrect — duplicates the base URL
private readonly usersEndpoint = 'https://api.example.com/api/users'
```

## When to call API through a page object vs. directly in a test

**Through a page object** — when the API call is part of setting up a reusable precondition that multiple tests need, or when the call logically belongs to the page's domain:

```ts
// page object method — reusable setup
private readonly usersEndpoint = '/api/users'

async seedUser(payload: object) {
  await this.post(this.usersEndpoint, payload)
}
```

```ts
// test — calls the page object, does not know the endpoint
test('display user profile', async ({ userPage }) => {
  await userPage.seedUser({ name: 'Alice' })
  await userPage.goto()
  await userPage.checkUserName('Alice')
})
```

**Directly via `apiRequest`** — when the call is a one-off teardown or verification that does not belong to any page object and would not be reused. Store the endpoint in a named constant, not as an inline string, and pass the method as `HttpMethod`, not a raw string:

```ts
import { HttpMethod } from '../support/constants/http_method'

test('delete user', async ({ userPage }) => {
  const userEndpoint = '/api/users/42'
  await userPage.deleteUser(42)
  const response = await userPage.apiRequest(HttpMethod.Get, userEndpoint)
  expect(response.status).toBe(404)
})
```

## Typing a JSON response

Don't redeclare an inline anonymous type every time a response is cast — reuse (or extend) the shared interface for that entity from `support/types/chronos/`:

```ts
// correct — shared type, single source of truth for the entity's shape
import { Todo } from '../../types/chronos/todo'

async countOpenTasks(): Promise<number> {
  const response = await this.get(this.todosEndpoint)
  const todos = (await response.json()) as Todo[]
  return todos.filter((t) => !t.completed).length
}

// incorrect — a fresh ad-hoc shape per call site, drifts out of sync with the real API
const todos = (await response.json()) as { completed: boolean }[]
```

If a method only needs a subset of fields, narrow the shared type instead of writing a new one — `Pick<Todo, 'id' | 'title'>` rather than `{ id: number; title: string }`.

## Rules

- Never hardcode `API_BASE_URL`, credentials, or auth headers — they come from environment variables automatically.
- `get`, `post`, `put`, `delete` are `protected` — call them only from within page object methods, not from test files.
- Use `apiRequest` in tests only when no suitable page object method exists and creating one would not be reused.
- Assert the response status or body in the test, not inside the page object method — page objects prepare data, tests verify outcomes.
- Type a JSON response with a shared interface from `support/types/chronos/` (adding one if it doesn't exist yet), not an inline anonymous type.
